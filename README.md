# Music Tribe Assignment
It is an assignment from Music Tribe.

The main objective is to draw a rotary control with below requirements:

- Rotary control can share codebase with lot of views.
- Rotary control shall be of two type (The rotary control must implement these type classifications as part of reusable UI Control itself)
    - Type 1 are of steps type (only certain values in tooltip) as in attached video
    - Type 2 should have float values in tooltip, that relates to the gesture.
- Both have certain min/max values, step size and image background.
- The control ui must adapt to different images (same rotary control but with different background image).
- The rotary control must implement this as part of reusable UI Control itself.
#### Use modular code and ensure that the MVVM design pattern is used.
### Avoid any external library
